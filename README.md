# Python DH USE CASE Pipeline 

Pipelines that use PyEDDL and PyECVL to train a CNN on three different datasets 
(_MNIST_, _ISIC_ and _PNEUMOTHORAX_), applying different image augmentations,
for both the classification and the segmentation task.

These Deep Neural Network examples derive from the [github.com/deephealthproject/use_case_pipeline](https://github.com/deephealthproject/use_case_pipeline)
_C++_ repository, which contains detailed instructions for downloading checkpoints and datasets.

These _Python_ implementations requires PyECVL, which can be installed following this [guide](https://deephealthproject.github.io/pyecvl/installation.html).
