# Python DH USE CASE Pipeline 

Pipeline that uses PyEDDL and PyECVL to train a CNN on three different datasets 
(_MNIST_, _ISIC_ and _PNEUMOTHORAX_), applying different image augmentations,
for both the classification and the segmentation task.

These Deep Neural Network examples derive from the [github.com/deephealthproject/use_case_pipeline](https://github.com/deephealthproject/use_case_pipeline)
_C++_ repository, which also includes links for checkpoints and datasets download.
